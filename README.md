Hello I am Ryan B

I am currently a Software Engineer that founded Freedom Script LLC for tutoring and software development.
I am also a tutor on other platforms to include Tutor.com, SuperProf, and PearDeck Tutor.
With FreedomScript and other platforms I have successfully helped over 1100 students with Computer Programming.

My passion is for teaching and developing software.

I am a former active duty Air Force Crew Chief that had a passsion for flying and working on aircraft. Through a serious
of injuries overseas my career was taken from me and I had to use my perseverance learned into the military to completely
restart my career in software engineering. Through multiple heart surgeries led to a lot of downtime and software developing
became a hobby and I eventually turned this into going to school for software engineering and starting Freedom Script LLC.

As a student at the University of Maryland Global Campus I found my passion for developing. Indirectly I also found that 
online school was much harder to retain developing procedures and knowledge. This is where I found that a tutor
service was absolutely needed. I used multiple tutoring platforms but never had any success in learning techniques. As a veteran
I found that we need more resources available to us for programming and this is why if you need an help with coding feel free 
to message me and we can collaborate on some projects or I can help with assignments as needed.

Cheers,
Ryan B
